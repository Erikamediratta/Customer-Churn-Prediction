# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a telecom customer 
will churn using the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset (7032 customers, 20 features).

## Live Demo
[Add Streamlit link here after deployment]

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn
- SHAP, LIME
- Streamlit

## What I Did
- Performed EDA on 7032 customers
- Compared 15 models (5 algorithms × Base, SMOTE, ADASYN)
- Applied RFE for feature selection
- Used SHAP and LIME for explainability
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV (540+ fits)
- Deployed as interactive web app using Streamlit

## Best Model
SVM with SMOTE — highest F1 score (0.574) for churn class

## How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

## Dataset
IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle
